QUIXOTIC

adj. Absurdly chivalric, like Don Quixote. An insight into the beauty
and excellence of this incomparable adjective is unhappily denied to him
who has the misfortune to know that the gentleman's name is pronounced
Ke-ho-tay.

    When ignorance from out of our lives can banish
    Philology, 'tis folly to know Spanish.
