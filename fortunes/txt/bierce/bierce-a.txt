ABDICATION

n. An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high temperature
of the throne.

    Poor Isabella's Dead, whose abdication
    Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.
    For that performance 'twere unfair to scold her:
    She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her.
    To History she'll be no royal riddle --
    Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle.
                                                                  G.J.
%
ABDOMEN

n. The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with sacrificial
rights, all true men engage. From women this ancient faith commands but a
stammering assent. They sometimes minister at the altar in a half-hearted
and ineffective way, but true reverence for the one deity that men really
adore they know not. If woman had a free hand in the world's marketing
the race would become graminivorous.
%
ABILITY

n. The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of the meaner

ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high degree of solemnity.
Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is rightly appraised; it is no
easy task to be solemn.
%
ABNORMAL

adj. Not conforming to standard. In matters of thought and conduct,
to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be detested.
Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward the straiter [sic]

thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and the hope of Hell.

ABORIGINES

n. Persons of little worth found cumbering the soil of a newly discovered
country. They soon cease to cumber; they fertilize.

ABRACADABRA.

    By Abracadabra we signify
        An infinite number of things.
    'Tis the answer to What? and How? and Why?
    And Whence? and Whither? -- a word whereby
        The Truth (with the comfort it brings)
    Is open to all who grope in night,
    Crying for Wisdom's holy light.

    Whether the word is a verb or a noun
        Is knowledge beyond my reach.
    I only know that 'tis handed down.
            From sage to sage,
            From age to age --
        An immortal part of speech!

    Of an ancient man the tale is told
    That he lived to be ten centuries old,
        In a cave on a mountain side.
        (True, he finally died.)
    The fame of his wisdom filled the land,
    For his head was bald, and you'll understand
        His beard was long and white
        And his eyes uncommonly bright.

    Philosophers gathered from far and near
    To sit at his feat and hear and hear,
            Though he never was heard
            To utter a word
        But "Abracadabra, abracadab,
            Abracada, abracad,
        Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!"
            'Twas all he had,
    'Twas all they wanted to hear, and each
    Made copious notes of the mystical speech,
            Which they published next --
            A trickle of text
    In the meadow of commentary.
        Mighty big books were these,
        In a number, as leaves of trees;
    In learning, remarkably -- very!

            He's dead,
            As I said,
    And the books of the sages have perished,
    But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.
    In Abracadabra it solemnly rings,
    Like an ancient bell that forever swings.
            O, I love to hear
            That word make clear
    Humanity's General Sense of Things.

ABRIDGE

v.t. To shorten.

        When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for
    people to abridge their king, a decent respect for the opinions of
    mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
    them to the separation.

ABSENT

adj. Peculiarly exposed to the tooth of detraction; vilifed; hopelessly
in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection of another.

    To men a man is but a mind.  Who cares
    What face he carries or what form he wears?
    But woman's body is the woman.  O,
    Stay thou, my sweetheart, and do never go,
    But heed the warning words the sage hath said:
    A woman absent is a woman dead.

limited monarchies, where the sovereign's power for evil (and for good)
is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are governed by chance.
%
ABSTAINER

n. A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a
pleasure. A total abstainer is one who abstains from everything but
abstention, and especially from inactivity in the affairs of others.

    Said a man to a crapulent youth:  "I thought
        You a total abstainer, my son."
    "So I am, so I am," said the scrapgrace caught --
        "But not, sir, a bigoted one."
                                                                  G.J.

ALTAR

n. The place whereupon the priest formerly raveled out the small intestine
of the sacrificial victim for purposes of divination and cooked its flesh

    The fire themselves in which their fat was fried.
    In vain the sacrifice! -- no god will claim
    An offering burnt with an unholy flame.

ART

n. This word has no definition. Its origin is related as follows by
the ingenious Father Gassalasca Jape, S.J.

    One day a wag -- what would the wretch be at? --
    Shifted a letter of the cipher RAT,
    And said it was a god's name!  Straight arose
    Fantastic priests and postulants (with shows,
    And mysteries, and mummeries, and hymns,
    And disputations dire that lamed their limbs)
    To serve his temple and maintain the fires,
    Expound the law, manipulate the wires.
    Amazed, the populace that rites attend,
    Believe whate'er they cannot comprehend,
    And, inly edified to learn that two
    Half-hairs joined so and so (as Art can do)
    Have sweeter values and a grace more fit
    Than Nature's hairs that never have been split,
    Bring cates and wines for sacrificial feasts,
    And sell their garments to support the priests.

severe practice upon the admiring male, who is pleased to fancy it
resembles the candid simplicity of his young.
%
ASPERSE

not had the temptation and opportunity to commit.
%
ASS

n. A public singer with a good voice but no ear. In Virginia City, Nevada,
he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, and everywhere the
Donkey. The animal is widely and variously celebrated in the literature,
art and religion of every age and country; no other so engages and fires
the human imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed, it is doubted by
some (Ramasilus, "lib. II., De Clem.", and C. Stantatus, "De Temperamente")
if it is not a god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans,
and, if we may believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also. Of the only two
animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of men,
the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other.
This is no small distinction. From what has been written about this beast
might be compiled a library of great splendor and magnitude, rivalling that
of the Shakespearean cult, and that which clusters about the Bible.  It may
be said, generally, that all literature is more or less Asinine.

    "Hail, holy Ass!" the quiring angels sing;
    "Priest of Unreason, and of Discords King!"
    Great co-Creator, let Thy glory shine:
    God made all else, the Mule, the Mule is thine!"
                                                                  G.J.

n. A country lying in the South Sea, whose industrial and commercial
development has been unspeakably retarded by an unfortunate dispute among
geographers as to whether it is a continent or an island.
%
AVERNUS

n. The lake by which the ancients entered the infernal regions. The fact
that access to the infernal regions was obtained by a lake is believed
by the learned Marcus Ansello Scrutator to have suggested the Christian
rite of baptism by immersion. This, however, has been shown by Lactantius
to be an error.

    Facilis descensus Averni,
        The poet remarks; and the sense
    Of it is that when down-hill I turn I
        Will get more of punches than pence.
