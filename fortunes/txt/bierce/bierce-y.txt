YESTERDAY

n. The infancy of youth, the youth of manhood, the entire past of age.

    But yesterday I should have thought me blest
        To stand high-pinnacled upon the peak
        Of middle life and look adown the bleak
    And unfamiliar foreslope to the West,
    Where solemn shadows all the land invest
        And stilly voices, half-remembered, speak
        Unfinished prophecy, and witch-fires freak
    The haunted twilight of the Dark of Rest.
    Yea, yesterday my soul was all aflame
        To stay the shadow on the dial's face
    At manhood's noonmark!  Now, in God His name
        I chide aloud the little interspace
    Disparting me from Certitude, and fain
    Would know the dream and vision ne'er again.
                                                      Baruch Arnegriff

YOKE

YOUTH

n. The Period of Possibility, when Archimedes finds a fulcrum, Cassandra
has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of endowing a living
Homer.

        Youth is the true Saturnian Reign, the Golden Age on earth
    again, when figs are grown on thistles, and pigs betailed with
    whistles and, wearing silken bristles, live ever in clover, and
    clows fly over, delivering milk at every door, and Justice never
    is heard to snore, and every assassin is made a ghost and,
    howling, is cast into Baltimost!
                                                        Polydore Smith
