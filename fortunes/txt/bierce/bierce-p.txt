by the good fortune of another.
%
PAINTING

n. The art of protecting flat surfaces from the weather and exposing
them to the critic.

    Formerly, painting and sculpture were combined in the same work:
the ancients painted their statues.  The only present alliance between
the two arts is that the modern painter chisels his patrons.
%
PALACE

n. A fine and costly residence, particularly that of a great official.
The residence of a high dignitary of the Christian Church is called a palace;
that of the Founder of his religion was known as a field, or wayside. There
is progress.
%
PALM

n. A species of tree having several varieties, of which the familiar
itching palm ('Palma hominis') is most widely distributed and sedulously
cultivated. This noble vegetable exudes a kind of invisible gum, which
may be detected by applying to the bark a piece of gold or silver.
The metal will adhere with remarkable tenacity. The fruit of the itching
palm is so bitter and unsatisfying that a considerable percentage of it
is sometimes given away in what are known as benefactions.
%
PALMISTRY

n. The 947th method (according to Mimbleshaw's classification) of
obtaining money by false pretences. It consists in reading character in
the wrinkles made by closing the hand. The pretence is not altogether
false; character can really be read very accurately in this way,
for the wrinkles in every hand submitted plainly spell the word dupe.
The imposture consists in not reading it aloud.
%
PANDEMONIUM

n. Literally, the Place of All the Demons. Most of them have escaped
into politics and finance, and the place is now used as a lecture hall
by the Audible Reformer. When disturbed by his voice the ancient echoes
clamor appropriate responses most gratifying to his pride of distinction.

PANTALOONS

n. A nether habiliment of the adult civilized male. The garment is
tubular and unprovided with hinges at the points of flexion. Supposed to

outrage.
%
PAST

n. That part of Eternity with some small fraction of which we have
a slight and regrettable acquaintance. A moving line called the Present
parts it from an imaginary period known as the Future. These two grand
divisions of Eternity, of which the one is continually effacing the other,
are entirely unlike. The one is dark with sorrow and disappointment, the
other bright with prosperity and joy. The Past is the region of sobs, the
Future is the realm of song. In the one crouches Memory, clad in sackcloth
and ashes, mumbling penitential prayer; in the sunshine of the other Hope
flies with a free wing, beckoning to temples of success and bowers of ease.
Yet the Past is the Future of yesterday, the Future is the Past of to-morrow.
They are one -- the knowledge and the dream.
%

debility.

whole. The dupe of statesmen and the tool of conquerors.

PATRIOTISM

n. Combustible rubbish read to the torch of any one ambitious to illuminate
his name.

    In Dr. Johnson's famous dictionary patriotism is defined as the
last resort of a scoundrel.  With all due respect to an enlightened
but inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the first.
%
PEACE

n. In international affairs, a period of cheating between two periods
of fighting.

    O, what's the loud uproar assailing
        Mine ears without cease?
    'Tis the voice of the hopeful, all-hailing
        The horrors of peace.

    Ah, Peace Universal; they woo it --
        Would marry it, too.
    If only they knew how to do it
        'Twere easy to do.

    They're working by night and by day
        On their problem, like moles.
    Have mercy, O Heaven, I pray,
        On their meddlesome souls!
                                                               Ro Amil

Perfection, promptly wrote at the foot of the letter:  I don't
agree with you, and mailed it to Matthew Arnold.
%
PERIPATETIC

adj. Walking about. Relating to the philosophy of Aristotle, who, while
expounding it, moved from place to place in order to avoid his pupil's
objections. A needless precaution -- they knew no more of the matter than
he.
%
PERORATION

n. The explosion of an oratorical rocket. It dazzles, but to an observer
having the wrong kind of nose its most conspicuous peculiarity is the smell
of the several kinds of powder used in preparing it.
%
PERSEVERANCE

n. A lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success.

    Persevere, persevere! cry the homilists all,
    Themselves, day and night, persevering to bawl.
    Remember the fable of tortoise and hare --
    The one at the goal while the other is -- where?
    Why, back there in Dreamland, renewing his lease
    Of life, all his muscles preserving the peace,
    The goal and the rival forgotten alike,
    And the long fatigue of the needless hike.
    His spirit a-squat in the grass and the dew
    Of the dogless Land beyond the Stew,
    He sleeps, like a saint in a holy place,
    A winner of all that is good in a race.

in locating and exploiting the organ that one is a dupe with.
%
PHYSICIAN

PHYSIOGNOMY

n. The art of determining the character of another by the resemblances
and differences between his face and our own, which is the standard of
excellence.

    There is no art, says Shakespeare, foolish man,
        To read the mind's construction in the face.
    The physiognomists his portrait scan,
        And say:  How little wisdom here we trace!
    He knew his face disclosed his mind and heart,
    So, in his own defence, denied our art.

                                                       Rev. Dr. Mucker
                         (in a funeral sermon over a British nobleman)

    Cold pie is a detestable
    American comestible.

    So far from that dear London.
               (from the headstone of a British nobleman in Kalamazoo)
%
PIETY

%
PIG

n. An animal ('Porcus omnivorus') closely allied to the human
race by the splendor and vivacity of its appetite, which, however, is inferior
in scope, for it sticks at pig.
%
PIGMY

parts of the world, but by modern in Central Africa only. The Pigmies are
so called to distinguish them from the bulkier Caucasians -- who are Hogmies.

leaving Europe in 1620 because not permitted to sing psalms through his

never read.
%
PLAGUE

n. In ancient times a general punishment of the innocent for admonition

candid concomitance of a brass band. To wrest the wealth of A from B and
leave C lamenting a vanishing opportunity.

organ is lacking; so she acts without motive, and her conscience, denied
burial, remains ever alive, confessing the sins of others.
%
POETRY

n. A form of expression peculiar to the Land beyond the Magazines.
%
POKER

n. A game said to be played with cards for some purpose to this lexicographer
unknown.
%

POLITICS

conduct of public affairs for private advantage.
%
POLITICIAN

n. An eel in the fundamental mud upon which the superstructure of organized
society is reared. When we wriggles he mistakes the agitation of his tail
for the trembling of the edifice. As compared with the statesman, he suffers
the disadvantage of being alive.
%
POLYGAMY

n. A house of atonement, or expiatory chapel, fitted with several stools
of repentance, as distinguished from monogamy, which has but one.
%
POPULIST

n. A fossil patriot of the early agricultural period, found in the
old red soapstone underlying Kansas; characterized by an uncommon spread
of ear, which some naturalists contend gave him the power of flight, though
Professors Morse and Whitney, pursuing independent lines of thought, have
ingeniously pointed out that had he possessed it he would have gone elsewhere.
In the picturesque speech of his period, some fragments of which have come
down to us, he was known as The Matter with Kansas.
%
PORTABLE

adj. Exposed to a mutable ownership through vicissitudes of possession.

    His light estate, if neither he did make it
    Nor yet its former guardian forsake it,
    Is portable improperly, I take it.

%
POSTERITY

%
POTABLE

n. Suitable for drinking. Water is said to be potable; indeed, some
declare it our natural beverage, although even they find it palatable only
when suffering from the recurrent disorder known as thirst, for which it
is a medicine. Upon nothing has so great and diligent ingenuity been brought
to bear in all ages and in all countries, except the most uncivilized,
as upon the invention of substitutes for water. To hold that this general
aversion to that liquid has no basis in the preservative instinct of the
race is to be unscientific -- and without science we are as the snakes
and toads.
%
POVERTY

n. A file provided for the teeth of the rats of reform. The number
of plans for its abolition equals that of the reformers who suffer from
it, plus that of the philosophers who know nothing about it. Its victims
are distinguished by possession of all the virtues and by their faith in

to be unknown.
%
PRAY

v. To ask that the laws of the universe be annulled in behalf of a
single petitioner confessedly unworthy.
%
PRE-ADAMITE

n. One of an experimental and apparently unsatisfactory race of antedated
Creation and lived under conditions not easily conceived. Melsius believed
them to have inhabited the Void and to have been something
intermediate between fishes and birds. Little its known of them beyond
the fact that they supplied Cain with a wife and theologians with a controversy.
%
PRECEDENT

n. In Law, a previous decision, rule or practice which, in the absence
of a definite statute, has whatever force and authority a Judge may choose
to give it, thereby greatly simplifying his task of doing as he pleases.
As there are precedents for everything, he has only to ignore those that
make against his interest and accentuate those in the line of his desire.
Invention of the precedent elevates the trial-at-law from the low estate
of a fortuitous ordeal to the noble attitude of a dirigible arbitrament.
%
PRECIPITATE

adj. Anteprandial.

    Precipitate in all, this sinner
    Took action first, and then his dinner.

%
PREDESTINATION

n. The doctrine that all things occur according to programme. This
doctrine should not be confused with that of foreordination, which means
that all things are programmed, but does not affirm their occurrence, that
being only an implication from other doctrines by which this is entailed.
The difference is great enough to have deluged Christendom with ink, to
say nothing of the gore. With the distinction of the two doctrines kept
well in mind, and a reverent belief in both, one may hope to escape perdition
if spared.
%
PREDICAMENT

n. The wage of consistency.
%
PREDILECTION

n. The preparatory stage of disillusion.
%
PRE-EXISTENCE

n. An unnoted factor in creation.

PREFERENCE

n. A sentiment, or frame of mind, induced by the erroneous belief that
one thing is better than another.

    An ancient philosopher, expounding his conviction that life is no
better than death, was asked by a disciple why, then, he did not die.
Because, he replied, death is no better than life.
    It is longer.
%
PREHISTORIC

adj. Belonging to an early period and a museum. Antedating the art
and practice of perpetuating falsehood.

    He lived in a period prehistoric,
    When all was absurd and phantasmagoric.
    Born later, when Clio, celestial recorded,
    Set down great events in succession and order,
    He surely had seen nothing droll or fortuitous
    In anything here but the lies that she threw at us.

PRESENTABLE

adj. Hideously appareled after the manner of the time and place.

    In Boorioboola-Gha a man is presentable on occasions of ceremony
if he have his abdomen painted a bright blue and wear a cow's tail; in
New York he may, if it please him, omit the paint, but after sunset he
must wear two tails made of the wool of a sheep and dyed black
%
PRESIDE

v. To guide the action of a deliberative body to a desirable result.
In Journalese, to perform upon a musical instrument; as, "He presided
at the piccolo."

        Read with a solemn face:
    "The music was very uncommonly grand --
            The best that was every provided,
            For our townsman Brown presided
        At the organ with skill and grace."
    The Headliner discontinued to read,
        And, spread the paper down
    On the desk, he dashed in at the top of the screed:
        "Great playing by President Brown."

n. The greased pig in the field game of American politics.
%
PRESIDENT

n. The leading figure in a small group of men of whom -- and of whom
only -- it is positively known that immense numbers of their countrymen
did not want any of them for President.

    If that's an honor surely 'tis a greater
    To have been a simple and undamned spectator.
    Behold in me a man of mark and note
    Whom no elector e'er denied a vote! --
    An undiscredited, unhooted gent
    Who might, for all we know, be President
    By acclimation.  Cheer, ye varlets, cheer --
    I'm passing with a wide and open ear!

in demanding it.

contributions. The Primate of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury,
an amiable old gentleman, who occupies Lambeth Palace when living and Westminster
Abbey when dead. He is commonly dead.
%
PRISON

n. A place of punishments and rewards. The poet assures us that --

    "Stone walls do not a prison make,"

but a combination of the stone wall, the political parasite and the
moral instructor is no garden of sweets.

and an impediment in his hope.
%
PROBOSCIS

n. The rudimentary organ of an elephant which serves him in place of
the knife-and-fork that Evolution has as yet denied him. For purposes of
humor it is popularly called a trunk.

    Asked how he knew that an elephant was going on a journey, the
illustrious Jo. Miller cast a reproachful look upon his tormentor,
and answered, absently:  "When it is ajar," and threw himself from
a high promontory into the sea.  Thus perished in his pride the most
famous humorist of antiquity, leaving to mankind a heritage of woe!
No successor worthy of the title has appeared, though Mr. Edward bok,
of "The Ladies' Home Journal", is much respected for the purity and
sweetness of his personal character.
%
PROJECTILE

n. The final arbiter in international disputes. Formerly these disputes
were settled by physical contact of the disputants, with such simple arguments
as the rudimentary logic of the times could supply -- the sword, the spear,
and so forth. With the growth of prudence in military affairs the projectile
came more and more into favor, and is now held in high esteem by the most
courageous. Its capital defect is that it requires personal attendance
at the point of propulsion.
%
PROOF

n. Evidence having a shade more of plausibility than of unlikelihood.
The testimony of two credible witnesses as opposed to that of only one.
%
PROOF-READER

n. A malefactor who atones for making your writing nonsense by permitting
